  <p class="lead">
    <strong>Global Management Consultancy Limited</strong> is an international advisory and services firm operating at the intersection of professional football and cross-border financial infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    We provide specialised football agency services and modern financial solutions through <strong>Global Sport Finance</strong>, supporting professional football clubs, agencies and players with multi-currency accounts, foreign exchange, international payments and card-based expense management.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Football is inherently international. Salaries, bonuses, transfers, sponsorship revenues and operating costs move across countries and currencies every day. Generic banking and payment solutions are rarely designed for this reality. Global Management Consultancy Limited was created to address this gap by combining sports industry expertise with modern financial services built specifically for international football operations.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Through <strong>Global Sport Finance</strong>, we deliver integrated treasury workflows, FX optimisation, cross-border payments and operational spending controls, helping clubs and agencies manage their financial operations efficiently while supporting players with practical tools for international living, travel and career mobility.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Our football agency services complement this financial infrastructure by providing professional representation, career strategy, contract negotiation support and club relations within the global game.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Our work is international by design and compliance-driven by structure. All payment services, e-money accounts, card issuing and foreign exchange services are delivered in partnership with FCA and EU regulated financial institutions, ensuring secure, compliant and scalable solutions for our international clients.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Global Management Consultancy Limited combines football industry expertise and institutional-grade financial infrastructure to support the modern realities of the global football ecosystem.
