  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Football is inherently international. Salaries, bonuses, transfers, sponsorship revenues and operating costs move across countries and currencies every day.

    Through <strong>Global Sport Finance</strong>, we deliver integrated treasury workflows, FX optimisation, cross-border payments and operational spending controls, helping clubs and agencies manage their financial operations efficiently while supporting players with practical tools for international living, travel and career mobility.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Our football agency services complement this financial infrastructure by providing professional representation, career strategy, contract negotiation support and club relations within the global game.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    Our work is international by design and compliance-driven by structure. All payment services, e-money accounts, card issuing and foreign exchange services are delivered in partnership with FCA and EU regulated financial institutions, ensuring secure, compliant and scalable solutions for our international clients.

  <h2>Why Global Management Consultancy</h2>
